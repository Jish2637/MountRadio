# Mount Radio

Simple plugin for FF XIV that lets you use a URL radio/live music stream whenever you mount up.

Audio stops when you dismount & will start/connect again when you mount up again.

Plays even if you are passenger on a mount.

Radio can be toggled off/on at any time, mounted or on foot.

Compatable & tested with Icecast Media Server/Mixxx & many public radio stations.

/radiosettings - Open the settings window

/radiotoggle - Toggle radio on/off

/radiovolume <1-100> - set the volume

/radioautostart - toggle radio auto starting when you mount up

/radioautostop - toggle radio auto stopping when you dismount

Its possible to use Icecast with Mixxx to setup your own custom radio and use it with this, allowing you to DJ live to listeners!
