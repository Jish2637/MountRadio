# Mount Radio

Simple plugin for FF XIV that lets you use a URL radio/live music stream whenever you mount up.

Audio stops when you dismount & will start/connect again when you mount up again.

Radio can also be toggled off/on at any time, mounted or on foot

/radiomount - Open settings

/radiovolume - 1-100 change the volume on the go.

/radiotoggle - toggle radio on/off anytime
